## Overview

In this work we introduce a fully automated pipeline for the segmentation of GBM and successive thickness estimation, starting from TEM images.
This method is based on an active semi-supervised learning training procedure of a convolutional neural network model.
Starting from the areas automatically identified by the model, we provide a robust measurement of membrane thickness using pixels distance matrix and computer vision techniques.
Using these values, we trained a machine learning model to automatically determine the GBM thickness.
Starting from a small subset of images manually annotated by expert pathologists, we performed a series of active semi-supervised learning rounds of training to obtain the complete annotation of the dataset.
The obtained segmentations were used for the automated estimation of GBM thickness via computer vision algorithms and compared with manual measurements, obtaining a correlation of Pearson's R2 of 0.85.
The proposed pipeline obtained state-of-the-art performance in GBM segmentation, proving its robustness under image variations, such as magnification, contrast, and complex geometrical shapes.

  abstract={Background: The measure of Glomerular Basement Membrane (GBM) thickness is commonly used as diagnostic criteria for several nephropathies, including genetic and metabolic diseases of the glomerulus. The GBM thickness measurement, a time-consuming task, is performed by expert pathologists on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, therefore, it is affected by subjectivity and reproducibility issues. Methods: In this work we introduce a fully automated pipeline for the segmentation of GBM and successive thickness estimation, starting from TEM images. This method is based on an active semi-supervised learning training procedure of a convolutional neural network model. Starting from the areas automatically identified by the model, we provide a robust measurement of membrane thickness using pixels distance matrix and computer vision techniques. Using these values, we trained a machine learning model to automatically determine the GBM thickness. To verify the accuracy of the method, we compared the predicted results with the full iconographic materials and diagnostic record reports from retrospectively selected 42 renal biopsies hypothetically having normal-thick GBM (n. 21), thin-GBM (n. 10, thin membrane disease), thick-GBM (n. 11, diabetic nephropathy). Eighty-nine TEM images associated with each patient record were recovered from the archive and used for the study. Results: Starting from a small subset of images manually annotated by expert pathologists, we performed a series of active semi-supervised learning rounds of training to obtain the complete annotation of the dataset. The obtained segmentations were used for the automated estimation of GBM thickness via computer vision algorithms and compared with manual measurements, obtaining a correlation of Pearsonâ€™s R2 of 0.85. The GBM thickness was stratified into 3 classes, namely normal, thin, thick with a 0.63 Matthews correlation coefficient and a 0.76 accuracy. Conclusions: The proposed pipeline obtained state-of-the-art performance in GBM segmentation, proving its robustness under image variations, such as magnification, contrast, and complex geometrical shapes. Automated measures could assist clinicians in standard clinical practice speeding up routine procedures with high diagnostic accuracy.},
